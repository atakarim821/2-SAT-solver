# 2-SAT-solver
This was a part of programming assignments of course Advanced Algorithms and Complexity where I implemented 2-SAT solver to check the satisfiability of constraints on modules of single layer of VLSI.

Program takes input as following
- First line take 2 integer value V and C representing number of variable and number of clauses.
- Each of next C line contains two integers representing each clause.
