# 2-SAT-Solver
This was a part of programming assignments of course Advanced Algorithms and Complexity where I implemented 2-SAT solver to check the satisfiability of constraints on modules of single layer of VLSI. This is the solution to first problem of assignment-4

Program takes input as following
- First line take 2 integer value V and C representing number of variable and number of clauses.
- Each of next C line contains two integers representing each clause.

Program output SATISFIABLE followed by assignment to each variable if formula is Satisfiable otherwise output UNSATISFIABLE.
